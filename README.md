# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It was completed as part of the IA651 course at Clarkson University.

## 🎯 Goals
- Understand and visualize the structure of imbalanced financial transaction data.
- Apply **SMOTE** to synthetically balance minority class (fraud).
- Train and compare multiple machine learning models.
- Evaluate performance using **accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score**, and **confusion matrices**.
- Visualize performance with plots for clearer insights.

## 📌 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations
- Class imbalance handling using SMOTE
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Model training with:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score
- Final model comparison table and bar plots

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
